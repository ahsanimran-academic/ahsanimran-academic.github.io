I am a Research Assistant at the MAIM Lab of Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering in the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently, I am working on a Wellcome Leap (In Utero) funded project (Title: Translation of a Wearable Fetal Movement Monitor towards Stillbirth Prevention) collaborating with University College Dublin to develop a wearable device to monitor fetal movements to prevent stillbirth. 

I have completed MSc and BSc degree from the University of Dhaka in Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering.
 <!-- My fourth year thesis project was on "Enhancing UAV Based Human Action Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach". ([Report Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPhvAta0VMs4gfy8zytuJPFYFACTSeHA/view)) -->

Research Interest
======
<!-- Ideally, I'm interested in Multi-modal Learnning at the intersection of Vision + Language. Overall, I am interested in building intelligent task assistants that augment human intelligence.  -->
Ideally, I'm interested in Multi-modal Signal Processing by leveraging deep learning model.

I have extensively collaborated on interdisciplinary projects in areas ranging from Wearable Medical Device development (specifically firmware and sensor signal processing and noise removal) to Machine Learning and Deep learning in Health Informatics and Biomechatronics. My current work revolves around machine learning challenges related to biomedical sensor data, e.g., learning with limited skewed data, supervised learning, and transfer learning with applications to Medical AI and Biomechatronics.
